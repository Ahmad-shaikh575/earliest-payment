    "### You got a car loan and you want to repay the loan early.<br> However, if you repay early, there is an early repayment penalty associated with it. The repayment penalty is a fixed amount or some percentage of the outstanding loan amount<br> – whichever is higher.<br>For example, consider a loan amount of $100,000 charged at 2.5% with a loan duration of 5 years.<br> If the borrower chooses to repay earlier, he will have to pay a repayment penalty which is equivalent to 15% of the remaining loan amount or a flat penalty fee of $1,000, whichever is higher.<br> Based on the terms of the car loan and the repayment payment, <br>the earliest time for early repayment is after 31 monthly payments has been made. <br>Implement a function early_repayment_breakeven(loan_amt, rate, loan_duration, flat_fee, penalty_rate) that will inform a borrower the earliest time that she can early repay her loan. <br>Her loan details are described by the loan_amt, rate and loan_duration and the early repayment penalty is either flat_fee or penalty_rate × outstanding loan amount, whichever is higher.\"<br> Pls run it using Jupyter Notebook."
